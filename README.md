### Abstract

As sea surface temperatures rise and ocean chemistry changes, it is important to understand how these shifts will impact marine life. Mollusks are integral parts of ocean ecosystems and compose a large portion of the shellfish industry; therefore changes to molluscan diversity will have widespread economic and ecological consequences. This study examines the effects of global warming and acidification on marine molluscan diversity across the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period (MPWP) in southeastern Virginia. The MPWP was an interval of warming that occurred from 3.264 to 3.025 Ma, during which sea surface temperatures rose approximately 3oC, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than pre-industrial levels. These conditions make it uniquely comparable to end-of-the century climate estimates and may provide insight into how modern mollusks will react to future climate change. Fossil molluscan assemblages from the Yorktown Formation that were deposited before, during, and after the MPWP were compiled from museum and field collections. Richness and diversity were quantified using rarefaction and Hill numbers, changes in species composition were measured using percent abundance, and community structure was assessed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA). Diversity peaks with warming and does not immediately return to pre-warming levels with subsequent cooling, and community structure differs significantly between each climate interval. Taxa exhibit species-specific responses in terms of abundance, with no uniform pattern across warming and cooling periods. As climate change intensifies, implications for modern molluscan fauna include long-term shifts in both diversity and community structure, which may have implications for ecosystem services.
